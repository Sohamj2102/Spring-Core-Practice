## ⚙️ Technologies Used
- Java 17+  
- Spring Core (No XML used, only annotations)

## 🛠 Features
- Uses **`AnnotationConfigApplicationContext`** as the IoC container.  
- Configuration is done with **`@Configuration` and `@Bean`** annotations.  
- Two classes (`Student` and `Address`) are registered as Spring beans.  
- **Dependency Injection** between beans is done using **`@Autowired`**.
